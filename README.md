Problem Statement :

A certain premium club boasts a large customer membership. The members pay an annual membership fee in return 
for using the exclusive facilities offered by this club. The fees are customized for every member's personal package.
In the last few years, however, the club has been facing an issue with a lot of members cancelling their memberships. 
The club management plans to address this issue by proactively addressing customer grievances. They, however, do not have
enough bandwidth to reach out to the entire customer base individually and are looking to see whether a statistical 
approach can help them identify customers at risk. Can you help them ? Relevant data is provided in the worksheet titled "Data".
